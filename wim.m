% This is the COST 231 Walfisch Ikegami model(WIM) used in propagation
% modelling in a wireless environment. It is an empherical model and is an
% improvement of the propagation model developed by Joram Walfisch and
% Henry L Bertoni with the building model developed by Ikegami.

%In the calculation of path loss, apart from the distance between the
%transmitter and the receiver, it takes into account the height of
%buildings, separation between buildings and width of the street. 

%The three main loss factors in WIM are
% 1. l_rts = Roof to street diffraction and scatter loss  
% 2. l_msd = Multi screen diffraction loss
% 3. l_fs = Free Space loss

%The various terms used in the calculation of the path loss are explained
%below.

% h_bs = transmitter antenna height from ground level in meters
% h_m = receiver antenna height in meters
% h_B = building height in meters
% b = building separation in meters
% w = width of street in meters
%Mod by BK:  phiflag=0 then don't include orientation
% phi = angle of incident wave wrt street (degrees)
% d = Distance between transmitter and receiver in km
% freq = Frequency of operation
%BK mod hataflag=1 requires Hata model
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
function [loss] = wim(h_bs, h_m, h_B, b, w, phiflag, phi, d, ...
    freq, city_type, hataflag)

if hataflag %exceeds valid range for WIM. Use Hata
    loss = hata (h_bs, h_m, d, freq, city_type, h_B);
    return
end

                l_ori = 4-0.114*(phi-55);
